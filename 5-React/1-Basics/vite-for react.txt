                       🛠️ How is Vite Different from Older Tools Like Webpack?


🐢 Old Tools (like Webpack):


When you start the app, it bundles (combines) all your files (JS, CSS, images) into big files.

This bundling takes time, especially if your app is large.

Every time you make a change, it re-bundles everything again.

This makes it slow to start and slow to update during development.



⚡ Vite:

Does NOT bundle everything when you start the app.

Uses modern browsers to load only the files that are needed.

If you change one file, only that file updates — super fast.

It still bundles your app later (for production), but only when you're ready to deploy.



                         📦 What Does "Bundle Your App" Mean?


Think of it like this:

Your app has many small files (components, styles, images).

Bundling means combining all those small files into a few big files so the browser can load them faster.

Old tools bundle everything before you even start working.

Vite skips bundling during development, which makes it lightning-fast.



                                   ✅ Summary (One-Liner)


Vite is a super-fast modern tool that helps you build and run React apps quickly, by skipping slow bundling during development and using smart optimization later
